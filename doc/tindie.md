**AIRDOS04** is a cutting-edge airborne radiation dosimeter and spectrometer, expertly crafted to measure cosmic radiation and perform dosimetry in mixed ionizing radiation fields. This high-performance instrument is vital for monitoring and analyzing cosmic radiation in aviation environments, offering unparalleled precision and reliability.

#### Why did we make it?
The inception of **AIRDOS04** was driven by the need for an advanced, user-friendly tool capable of accurately measuring cosmic radiation levels in aircraft. Recognizing the importance of radiation safety for flight crews and scientific research, our team designed AIRDOS04 to provide critical data that contributes to understanding and managing ionizing radiation exposure in aviation settings.

#### What makes it special?

AIRDOS04 stands out due to its unique blend of technical sophistication and practical design:

  * **Advanced Detection Technology:** Utilizing a Silicon PIN diode and 470 ±3 energy channels, it delivers high-precision measurements across a wide energy range (60 keV to 7 MeV). Its high resolution of 15 ±2 keV ensures detailed and accurate data collection.
  * **Modular and Durable Design:** Encased in a sturdy aluminum box, interchangeable modules for data storage and power supply complement the core detection unit. This modular approach not only simplifies maintenance but also enhances the device's longevity and reliability.
  * **User-Friendly Operation:** The instrument's design prioritizes ease of use, featuring automatic activation with LED indicators, straightforward battery level checks, and convenient USB-C charging.
  * **Environmental Adaptability:** Engineered to operate within a temperature range of 0°C to 50°C and an IP30 rating, AIRDOS04 is well-suited for various field conditions. Its size and weight are optimized for integration into aircraft manual bays, making it a perfect fit for aviation applications.
  * **Radiation Safety Focus:** The AIRDOS04 was developed with a strong emphasis on radiation safety, making it an essential tool for flight crews, researchers, and professionals involved in ionizing radiation safety. It provides vital data for effective radiation management and safety protocols in aviation environments.

#### Aircraft Fly-Crew Cosmic Ray Dosimeter

AIRDOS04 is designed for measuring mixed radiation fields caused by secondary cosmic rays at higher altitudes. Flight altitudes in the atmosphere are a typical example of a mixed radiation field.
