# AIRDOS04 - Airborne cosmic radiation dosimeter designed for airliner dosimetry

The upgraded version of [AIRDOS02](https://github.com/UniversalScientificTechnologies/AIRDOS02). The instrument is designed primarily for the dosimetry of cabin crew and flight attendants of commercial flights. A detailed description of the use is in the [user manual](https://docs.dos.ust.cz/airdos/AIRDOS04).
